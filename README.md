# Study Smart Agent

> **Note:** This project is still under development and is not fully ready for production use. Features and documentation may change as development progresses.

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    The Agent Development Kit typically manages dependencies within its framework. Ensure you have followed the setup instructions for the Kit itself. If your agent has specific Python dependencies, list them in a `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    # If you have a requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configuration:**
    *   Ensure your Google Cloud project is correctly configured (`gcloud init`, `gcloud auth application-default login`).
    *   Update any necessary configuration files within the `/study_smart` directory (e.g., API keys, model settings) as per the Agent Development Kit documentation and your specific agent's needs.

## Running the Agent

1.  **Navigate to the agent directory:**
    ```bash
    cd study_smart
    ```

2.  **Run the agent using the Agent Development Kit tools:**
    The exact command depends on how the Agent Development Kit launches agents. It might look something like this (refer to the official Kit documentation for the precise command):
    ```bash
    # Example command - replace with actual command from Agent Dev Kit
    agent-dk run .
    ```
    Or, if it's a Python-based execution:
    ```bash
    # Example if run via a main Python script
    python main.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the agent:**
    Once running, you can interact with the agent through the interface provided by the Agent Development Kit or the specified communication channels (e.g., a web interface, command line, API).
